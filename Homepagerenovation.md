Rename the top friends Activation Points


Personal Impact Snapshot should be at the top of the homepage. Think of this as like a weather report for governance.Good Stats:
- Decisions Influenced: “Your input influenced 3 decisions this month.”
- Funds guided: “$x,xxx allocated with your participation”
- Communities supported: “2 initiatives you engaged with activated”
* “This week’s discussions: High signal”
* “Most proposals reached consensus without conflict”
* “Agents are actively synthesizing community input”


Later on not right now, we would like to personalize traits and things people want to see in their decision making style, but for right now we will just adjust the homepage to accommodate making it feel like gamification for it’s own sake.

Your Voice, Remembered

What it answers: “Did the system actually hear me?”

This is huge psychologically.

Stats / indicators:

Last contribution acknowledged

“Your feedback from Jan 4 has been incorporated”

Themes you care about

“Your interests: access, prevention, practitioner support”

Agent memory active

“Your preferences are informing future proposals”

Why this works:

Prevents the “black hole” feeling of forms and surveys

Builds trust without notifications or dopamine tricks

Creates continuity of self across time

This is especially important for mental health contexts, where being forgotten is a core fear.

4. Collective Progress Without Pressure

What it answers: “Are we moving forward—without me having to push?”

Instead of “activity metrics,” show directional movement.

Examples:

Initiatives in motion

“4 proposals moving toward funding”

Community alignment trend

“Consensus is increasing this week”

Time saved by async decisions

“~18 hours of meetings avoided”

Why this works:

Reinforces that rest is allowed

Removes guilt-driven engagement

Makes async participation feel legitimate and respected

This is critical for not recreating hustle culture inside a mental health product.

5. Gentle Orientation: ‘What Needs You (Optional)’

What it answers: “Is there something meaningful I could do—without obligation?”

This should never feel urgent.

Examples:

“One proposal could benefit from lived experience”

“An agent flagged a decision where more voices would help”

“Optional reflection available (5 minutes)”

Stats to support it:

Estimated time cost

“~3–5 minutes”

Emotional load indicator

“Low intensity / reflective”

Deadline clarity

“No urgency”

Why this works:

Respects emotional bandwidth

Increases long-term retention

Builds trust that the system won’t exploit attention

Stats You Should Not Emphasize (Given Your Mission)

Avoid highlighting:

Daily streaks

Log-in counts

Competitive ranks

“Power users”

Volume-based participation

Those metrics:

Increase anxiety

Reward performative engagement

Undermine psychological safety
